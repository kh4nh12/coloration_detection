# coloration_detection
Water Hackathon - Team Neptune

In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the discoloration. 

Up to 16 million colors can actually be detected based on the RGB Color Model. Therefore, to accurately distinguish these colors, the project uses Python and the Codebrainz color data file to build an application that accurately recognizes colors on any image.

Before starting with this Python project with source code, you should be familiar with the computer vision library of Python that is OpenCV and Pandas.

OpenCV, Pandas, and numpy are the Python packages that are necessary for this project in Python. To install them, simply run this pip command in your terminal:
!pip install opencv-python numpy pandas
